ideagora - a place to share and discover info about you and your fellow Railscampers

Done:
- user auth by email address or twitter handle (no password)
- a simple profile form for each user with contact info, bio, and skills/interests tagging


To-Do:
- view / edit talks
- view / edit project info for each user


Someday Maybe:
- a bonjour chat bot could do some neat things:
  - when browsing users, could show live 'online/offline' info next to each name for users with bonjour chat names in their profile
  - broadcast talk info
